### Contributing
I consider this project open-source, so if anyone would like to make or suggest changes, please reach out! I'm sure there are bugs that I haven't caught yet.

The source code can be found in my [psv_src](https://github.com/Niimphu/psv_src) repo. I hope to try and reduce the file size of the binary in the future.

## ðŸŒ™ How to use


### Adding your push_swap executable to the program

Using the default file explorer for your system -NOT your code editor- drag and drop your compiled `push_swap` executable into the program window.

### Running the visualiser

1. Enter the number of values you would like to test into the `Stack size` box 
2. Click `Generate` to generate a set of random integers based on your stack size.
3. Click `Compute` to run the generated values through your `push_swap` executable. The visualiser will display the total number of lines that your `push_swap` generated, as well as the next five steps that will be run.
4. Change the speed from the drop-down menu as desired (Default value `x1`).
5. Click `Play/Pause` to run the program.

To run the program again, make sure to click `Reset`, or re-`Generate` and `Compute` the values.

### Optional features

The `>` and `<` buttons can be used to step forward and back while the program is paused.
Optionally, you can also change the theme using the drop down menu. The defaul colour set is `Whiteout`.
